/*
sometimes I want to do something that is not bad but I know that what is good for me is to do another thing.
for example, when I know that I should sit study and work hard, but I get an urge to go and have fun and relax
today I resisted the urge and now I am trying to write code. Yesterday I did not resist the urge and I didn't 
write code, let me say that I had a plan of building things and solving exercises daily. Let me explain my pro-
blem very well. I have a goal of becoming a world class software engineer, specifically having done 25 million
exercises in the fields of operating systems development, computer security systems development, computer networks
development, cyber security systems development and application softwares development, the exercises will be many
because of the 20 million exercises that I want to invest in sciences, and I have to build 100k software projects
. Now the second goal I have is to achieve these goals by 2024, which means there is a must learning pace that I 
must adopt every daily, NOT DOING THIS LEARNING PACE SETS ME UP FOR MORE HARD WORK IN THE FUTURE AND DOING MORE
REDUCES THE WORK I HAVE TO DO IN THE FUTURE AND TIME, WHAT I DO DAILY AFFECTS BY TIME OR WORK ETHIC.

I become sad because the work ethic I have to master to achieve this goal is hard and almost impossible which means
that since my personality is a weak one, I am not even able to sit for long hours and just do what I can let alone 
what I have to do, I give up fast.
by

quotes of daily improvement, measured according to the daily inputs only

quotes of pace consistency, measured by comparing the daily inputs and pace expected


I need some kind of reminder that it will end I just have to stick on the plan.
I need some kind of goal related consequences app that shows me how my daily actions affect my entire
goal by having more work to do per day, or working for more years, which will have some kind of daily
evaluation, and once I fill in the daily evaluation, I get the consequences or the newly calculated
remaining work, the daily pace it would take, the time it would take once I obey the daily pace, if I 
increased efforts depending on my history, if I am on the right pace percentage. 

what is grit? the ability of doing something when someone's life depends on it?

so when I think about what I have to go through and that my failure will affect someone's life or even
mine in a very bad way, I become afraid, and I try to create the illusion that life will not be affected
this fear forces someone to get rid of it, how do one get rid of fear, by proving to himself that 
not doing anything will be okay, and this leads to negligance, so fear can be a good thing because
it tells you the truth, but I hate fear? Isn't there any way to get what you want and still not have
fear, like is there a way of being aware of danger and deal with it with out being afraid.

How to build a goal tracking app that promotes awareness of problems instead of fear of problems?

how do people promote fear?
the number one people who promote fear are not the ones who have it, but the ones who believe that,
for progress to exist, one has to be afraid?

But before I solve the problem, let me first simulate the problem in the most realistic way as possible
at the extent that any one using the app will immediately understand what I am talking about, in fact
this is what I can achieve with a computer and a programming language, explaining to a computer my,
problems and figuring out the solutions together, because just because I have whatsapp doesn't mean that 
I don't talk to friends no more, it is just that not the computer helps alot. And that is why in this case
the computer will also help me to solve the problems I have in my life, which is fear and how I can achieve
my goals, with less fear.

This is what happens,
